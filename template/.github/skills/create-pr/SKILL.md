description: >
  Create a pull request using the project's PR template. Use when the user says
  "create a PR", "open a PR", "submit for review", "push and PR", or any variation.
  Also used by the orchestrator's pr-subagent. Expects changes to be committed and
  pushed already and skill pre-pr-gate to be run first.

# Create Pull Request

## Prerequisites

Before creating the PR, verify:

1. **Not on main/master** — refuse to create a PR from the default branch.
2. **Changes are committed** — no uncommitted work.
3. **Branch is pushed** — `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)` if needed.
4. **No existing PR** — check with `gh pr view --json url,number 2>/dev/null`.
   If it returns data, a PR already exists — report the existing URL and stop.
   If it exits non-zero (no PR), proceed.

## PR Format

Follow PR template `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## Title Convention

Use same conventional commit prefix as branch/commits.

## Procedure

1. **Gather context** from `git log`, `git diff main`, branch name, and beads tasks.
2. **Write title** — derive from commits or branch name.
3. **Write body** — fill template sections from diff and commit messages.
   Keep concise. Bullet points, not prose.
4. **Create PR** — pass title and body as task variables (not inline shell args):
   ```
   task pr:create TITLE="<title>" BODY="<rendered body>"
   ```
5. **Report** PR URL.

## Rules

- **Never merge** — only create. The user decides when to merge.
- **Always provide explicit title and body** — do not rely on `--fill`.
- If quality gates haven't been run, invoke `pre-pr-gate` skill.

## Scope Boundary

Skill handles **PR creation only**. For the full pre-PR workflow (quality
gates → beads sync → push), use `pre-pr-gate` skill first, then this skill
to create PR.
