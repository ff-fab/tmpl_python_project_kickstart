# Tooling Instructions

## Golden Rule

**Never invoke `python` or `python -m` directly.** All commands go through either:

1. **`task <name>`** — preferred, uses the Taskfile.yml definitions
2. **`uv run <command>`** — fallback when no task exists

## Task Commands (use these first)

Run `task --list` to see all available tasks. Key tasks for development:

| Need                          | Command                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Run all unit tests            | `task test:unit`                             |
| Run a specific test file      | `task test:file -- tests/unit/test_foo.py`   |
| Run tests matching a pattern  | `task test:file -- -k test_my_function`      |
{%- if robot_framework %}
| Run integration tests         | `task test:integration`                      |
| Run specific Robot file       | `task test:file:robot -- tests/integration/login.robot` |
{%- endif %}
| Run tests with coverage       | `task test:cov`                              |
| Lint (ruff check + format)    | `task lint`                                  |
| Fix lint issues               | `task lint:fix`                              |
| Type check (mypy)             | `task typecheck`                             |
| All checks (lint+type+test)   | `task check`                                 |
| Pre-PR quality gate           | `task pre-pr`                                |
| Wait for CI on a PR           | `task ci:wait -- <pr-number>`                |
| Preview docs                  | `task docs:serve`                            |
| Sync dependencies             | `task sync`                                  |

## When no task exists

For one-off commands not covered by the Taskfile, use `uv run`. Since project
dependencies live in `packages/pyproject.toml`, run from within that directory:

```bash
# Correct — run from the packages/ directory
cd packages
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py -v
uv run mypy src/{{ module_name }}/_health.py
uv run ruff check src/
{%- if robot_framework %}
uv run robot tests/integration/login.robot
{%- endif %}

# Or from the repo root, target the project explicitly:
uv run --project packages pytest packages/tests/unit/test_foo.py -v

# WRONG — never do this
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_foo.py -v
python tests/scripts/summarize_tests.py
```

## Why

- `uv run` ensures the correct virtual environment and dependencies are used
- `task` commands encode project conventions (flags, working directory, coverage
  thresholds) so agents don't need to remember them
- Bare `python` may pick up the wrong interpreter or miss dependencies

## Suggesting Taskfile changes

If you find yourself repeatedly needing a command pattern that doesn't have a task,
**propose adding it to `Taskfile.yml`** rather than using raw `uv run` calls. This is
preferred because tasks encode conventions once and all agents/developers benefit.
