{% raw %}# Release Please — automates changelog, version bumps, and GitHub Releases.
#
# On every push to main, release-please updates (or opens) a release PR.
# Merging that PR creates a GitHub Release with a SemVer tag (vX.Y.Z).
#
# When a release is created, the package is first published to TestPyPI.
# After TestPyPI succeeds, PyPI publish requires manual approval via the
# "pypi" GitHub Environment protection rule.
