{% raw %}# Build and cache the devcontainer image to GHCR.
#
# This is separate from the CI workflow (Separation of Concerns):
# - The image changes rarely (only when dev tooling changes)
# - CI jobs pull the pre-built image instead of building from scratch each run
# - Weekly schedule picks up base image security patches automatically
#
# The image is pushed to
# ghcr.io/ff-fab/{% endraw %}{{ project_name }}{% raw %}-devcontainer
# and used by ci.yml via the devcontainers/ci action's cacheFrom parameter.
