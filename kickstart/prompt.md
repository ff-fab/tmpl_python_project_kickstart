The folder `old` contains a legacy project that serves as reference and requirements
input for this project.

Treat it as a domain-specific baseline implementation and derive requirements from the
existing behavior, interfaces, and constraints.

Please derive the specification and requirements from the code and re-develop the
project from scratch, following best practices and modern software engineering
principles. The new implementation should be fully tested, highly maintainable, and
well-documented.

The new project shall be structured as a Python package in `packages/src/`, with clear
separation of concerns and modular design, and configuration with pydantic. It should
include a comprehensive test suite in `packages/tests` and full documentation using
mkdocs in folder `docs`.

Please guide me through all design questions that you have, and ask for any
clarification you need. Then create the development plan and tasks in beads.
